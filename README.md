In this standalone project, users are provided with the path and parameters required for the Path Planning (PP) algorithm. The PP algorithm dynamically adjusts the steering angle to ensure the vehicle accurately follows the specified trajectory. To facilitate a deeper comprehension of the algorithm, each component is meticulously explained, supplemented with references to relevant studies.
